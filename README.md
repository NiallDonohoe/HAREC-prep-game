# HAREC-prep-game

##
The Harmonised Amateur Radio Examination Certificate is the exam required in Ireland to obtain a Radio Experementers License.
The HAREC syllabus was devised by the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations – CEPT.  
Holders of the HAREC qualification are entitled to apply for an Amateur Station Licence in Ireland (and in many other countries).

This game is intended to provide a fun way of learning country prefixes (currently implemented) and at a later stage Q-codes.

Full instructions for how to play will come at a later date.
